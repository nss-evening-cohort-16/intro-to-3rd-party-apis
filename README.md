# Intro to Third-party (external) APIs

When you are new to development, often you will hear other devs talk about APIs and you may be wondering what they are and may even be a little intimidated.

This repo is a few handpicked API lessons you can do to get familiar with some simple APIs and their docs.

## Get Started
- [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Start a new project using one of the following templates:
  - If we have started React, use this template: React Template in your Cohort Repo
  - If we are still working on JS use this template: Webpack Template in your Cohort Repo
- Go ahead and create an account and an API Key on the Open Weather API because it takes a couple of hours for the API Key to kick in and doing so will mean the key will be ready when you are ready.

## Quick Projects
Start with the first project and work down the list. DO NOT SKIP!
